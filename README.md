# Employee Attrition Prediction

Predicting employee attrition is critical for organizations to maintain productivity, morale, and control hiring costs. This project uses machine learning to analyze key factors driving employee exits and build a predictive model for HR teams.

# Project Description

- Explored and preprocessed HR data (over 14,000 employee records)
- Analyzed relationships between satisfaction levels, working hours, salary, and promotions
- Built a logistic regression model to predict employee exit
- Achieved an accuracy score of **76.8%**, indicating reliable prediction strength

# Key Insights 

- Employees who left typically had **low satisfaction** and **no recent promotion**
- Turnover was highest in the **low salary bands** and departments like **Sales**
- **Working long hours** combined with **low satisfaction** strongly predicted exits
- Only **0.5%** of exited employees were promoted in the last 5 years

# Tools Used

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
